0.7.3 - (coming soon)

- Connections that are about to be expired no longer bother to reset
  themselves (because they'll never be used again anyway). This was
  causing problems if the connection had connectivity problems to the
  database which then caused problems during the reset.

- Fixed ConcurrentModificationException that happened in some
  environments during automatic statement closure.
   
0.7.2 - April 28, 2003

- Moved DataSourceTest into Sandbox so that the Ant test target
  runs correctly.

- Fixed a bug in ConfigurationListener that meant that if you passed
  a Properties object to the Driver when asking for a connection to an
  existing pool it incorrectly called ConfigurationListenerIF.definitionUpdated
  when there was no change, and didn't call it when there was.

0.7.1 - April 19, 2003

- Added a lot of concurrency code - mainly using concurrent package
  written by Doug Lea. 

- Fixed display bug in AdminServlet - average active time was being
  displayed in milliseconds instead of seconds.

- Refactoring of how definitions are updated and redefined. Use
  ProxoolFacade.updateConnectionPool  to make incremental changes
  and ProxoolFacade.redefineConnectionPool to reset the definition
  and start again. (If you pass a Properties object to the DriverManager
  when asking for a connection this will call redefineConnectionPool.)

- if you change the url or any of the delegate properties for a pool's
  definition then all existing connections are automatically killed so that
  new ones are created that conform to the new definition.

- Change to ConfigurationListenerIF API. defintionChanged is now
  called definitionChanged (stupid spelling error).

- ConnectionListenerIF.onDeath now gets called for all connections
  closed during shutdown.

- Pools manually removed (using ProxoolFacade.removeConnectionPool)
  are no longer attempted to be removed during shutdown.

- Maximum-new-connections property has been deprecated in favour of
  the more descriptive simultaneous-build-throttle property.

- Refactoring of house keeper and prototyper so that the number of threads
  used by Proxool is more scalable. (Proxool used to create two threads
  per pool).

- Moved AdminServlet to servlet sub-package to make way for upcoming
  JMX admin implementation.

- Fixed bug where ConfigurationListenerIF.definitionUpdated was getting called
  when you passed a Properties object to the Driver regardless if whether the
  definition had changed.

0.7 - February 21, 2003

- We have dropped the dependency on commons-logging.jar
  by copying the code into our own project (retaining credit to
  the Jakarta team, naturally).

- New admin package provides statistical
  and snapshot information so you can measure how well Proxool, and
  your database, is doing.

- New AdminServlet provides statistical
  information for your web application.

- The JDK 1.2 patch code has been brought up to date and now
  passes all the unit tests.

- The listener code has been redone. Proxool now allows multiple
  listeners per pool. setFooListener has now been deprecated in
  favour of addFooListener. And it's now thread safe (just in case you
  add or remove a listener while the pool is running).

- The new ServletConfigurator will help you
  to configure and shutdown your pools simply by adding a few lines to
  your servlet configuration (web.xml) file and perhaps writing an XML file.
  No changes to your Java code.

- By using ShutdownHooks (with JDK1.3 or later) we get a cleaner, more
  reliable shutdown of the pools when the JVM stops.

- Removed ReloadMonitor (added in 0.5) because it made use of
  SystemProperties and this is prohbited by J2SE. You are now responsible
  for ensuring Proxool is shutdown if your application is reloaded within
  the same environment (as can sometimes happen in a web application).
  See ProxoolFacade.shutdown().

- Fixed bug when you asked DatabaseMetaData for the connection. It
  now gives you back the Proxool connection, not the underlying delegate
  connection.

- Fixed bug where if you registered, removed and then re-registered a pool
  then the new pool would not notice the Properties passed to it.

- If a connection encounters a fatal SQLException (as defined by the
  fatal-sql-exception property) it now wakes up the house keeper thread
  so other connections are tested as soon as possible (with the
  house-keeper-test-sql) rather than waiting for the next scheduled sweep.

0.6 (January 23, 2003)

- ProxoolFacade API has changed slightly. Some of the methods no
  longer throw an SQLException but a ProxoolException instead.
  This might lead to some small changes in your code.

- There used to be some ambiguity about whether you referred to a
  pool by its alias or its full url (when using ProxoolFacade). This has
  now been fixed. This means you can now change the url (to use a
  different database for instance) without creating a new pool.

- Version information is now logged so you can tell what version of
  Proxool you are using.

- ConnectionPoolStatisticsIF now reports the time the pool was started.

- We now use FastArrayList (from Jakarta Commons) instead of the
  JDK's Vector for improved collection support.

- New XMLConfigurator and PropertyConfigurator to make it easy
  to configure proxool from a file.

- New ConfigurationListenerIF interface allows you to implement persistent
  configuration

- Bug fix for JDBC drivers that implement the Statement interface
  indirectly (that is, extend a class that implements it rather than
  implementing it directly). (Credit to Martin Crawford).

- Unclosed Statements are now automatically closed when the
  Connection is closed, in accordance with the JDBC spec.

- Rollback is called on all connections when they are closed (that is,
  returned to the pool). This has no effect if autoCommit it true (default)
  or any pending transactions have been committed or already rolled back.
  This will only have an effect if you currently close connections with
  pending transactions.

- New ProxoolFacade#getDelegateStatement allows you to get to
  the underlying JDBC Driver's original Statement if you really need
  to. (This isn't recommended unless you have no other choice).

- You can now update the URL for a pool, not just the properties.
  See ProxoolFacade#updateConnectionPool.

0.5 (December 3, 2002)

- Fix finalisation of old instances. If you deploy to some environments in
  a certain way then it is possible for the class to be reloaded without the
  finalize() method being called. This will result in spurious house keeping
  threads remaining. The new ReloadMonitor avoids this.

- Various improvements to the logging to make it more informative and
  cleaner.

- Checkstyle improvements. We now enforce variable names and line length.
  Javadoc enforcement to come soon.

- Made the onBirth() method of ConnectionListenerIF interface failsafe. And
  removed obsolete cleanupClob() method (which was never called anyway)..

- Removed redundant logFilename stuff from ConnectionPoolDefinition. All
  logging is handled by Jakarta Commons's Logging anyway.

- Fix when removing pools that meant that when you tried to add them again
  Proxool thought it was a duplicate (Credit to Dan Milstein).

- Improvements to the way Proxool detects changes to the pool definition
  when resending the Properties object when you get a connection. Now
  detects when it has changed which means that we don't do
  unnecessary configuration and log is improved (we now log properties
  as they are set or updated).

- Fix to the ProxyConnection within the equals() method that was causing
  identical conections to be incorrectly reported as unequal (which leads to
  problems when adding them to some collections).

- Improvements to test classes. Lots more tests.

- Added support for resetting connection properties when it is returned to
  the pool (autoCommit, catalog, readOnly, transactionIsolation, typeMap
  and holdability). These  properties are reset to the values when the connection
  was made everytime it is returned. (credit to Tim Morley)

- Connection.isClosed() now returns true when it is back in the pool.

- New trace property allows you to log each execution, the SQL, the parameters
  used, and the execution time (DEBUG level). Use proxool.trace=true property.
  You can also get this information if you register a ConnectionListenerIF (use
  ProxoolFacade's setConnectionListener() method). This won't effect performance
  if you're not listening or have trace off.

- Prototyping is now off by default. To enable prototyping you need to set the
  proxool.prototype-count property to something sensible (like 5, for instance).
  [Prototyping is where spare connections are when the number of available
  connections approaches zero.]

- Fix for catching fatal SQL exceptions. This is a feature that throws away connections
  that encounter certain types of exception.

0.4 - September 19, 2002

- Rethink of how we organise our source code so that we can easily build
  to include different optional components.

- Use the Jakarta Commons' ultra-thin log wrapper. This allows you to
  plugin whatever logging component you like.

- Switched to use of the Proxy class so that we are not tied to a particular
  version of the JDK. However, this does mean a bit of patching to work with
  JDK 1.2 (Proxy was introduced in 1.3). Fortunately, this patch is handled
  easily using Ant.

- Test classes now make use of Hypersonic. A pure Java database with a very
  small footprint. This means we can run the tests without having to rely on
  the existence of a separate database.

- Layout and code style changes in accordance with CheckStyle

- New XMLConfigurator using JAXP to configure your connection pools.

- Improvments in Junit testing.
